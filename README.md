## Technologies Used

This project is developed using a modern full-stack approach, leveraging the following key technologies:

### Frontend Development
-   **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Chosen for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering.
-   **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development experience with features like instant server start and lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
-   **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions, enhancing code quality, readability, and maintainability, especially in larger codebases.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A highly customizable, utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development by composing styles directly in markup.
-   **Lucide React**: A collection of beautiful, open-source, and customizable SVG icons, integrated for enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the interface.

### Backend Development
-   **Node.js**: A robust JavaScript runtime environment that allows for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications.
-   **Express.js**: A minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
-   **Mongoose**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js. It simplifies interactions with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution to model application data.

### Database Management
-   **MongoDB**: A popular NoSQL document database. It offers high performance, high availability, and easy scalability, making it ideal for handling diverse and evolving data structures.

## Setup and Local Installation

To set up and run this project on your local machine, please follow the instructions below. Ensure you have all prerequisites installed.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

-   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher (LTS version recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **npm**: Node Package Manager, which comes bundled with Node.js.
-   **MongoDB**: A running instance of MongoDB. You can install it locally or use a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas. Refer to the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) for installation guides.

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change the current directory to the `backend` folder of the project:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Install backend dependencies**:
    Install all necessary Node.js packages for the backend by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**: (Optional but Recommended)
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection string and any other necessary environment variables. For example:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    PORT=5000
    ```
    Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB URI.
4.  **Start the backend server**:
    Launch the backend server. It will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` and connect to your MongoDB instance.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Verify that the server starts without errors and successfully connects to your MongoDB database.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the project's root directory**:
    If you are still in the `backend` directory, move up one level to the project's root:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
2.  **Install frontend dependencies**:
    Install all required npm packages for the frontend:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the frontend development server**:
    Start the Vite development server. The frontend application will be accessible in your web browser.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port indicated in your terminal) to view the application.
